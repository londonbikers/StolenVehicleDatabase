# StolenVehicleDatabase
An ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, C#, Linq and SQL Server website (stolenvehicledatabase.org) we launched to track and advertise stolen vehicles. Gained some traction with the public and Police forces. We handled a server move badly and file uploads didn't survive. We took the decision to leave the site offline, which we see as a mistake in hindsight.

## Design

Early design, we changed later to a black theme with new branding that was kindly donated.
